# DEMUSE For Beginners

Welcome to DEMUSE For Beginners! If this is your first time programming, it's recommended to start with a more reliable,
secure and serious language, also known as a "real" programming language. DEMUSE is a toy language originally developed
as an exercise to learn about compilers and pogramming languages, and today still is nothing more than that.

If however, you are not beginning programming, and for some unknown reason, are still interested in learning more about
DEMUSE, keep on reading!

## Installing

Everything that is needed to run (the compiler) DEMUSE scripts and develop DEMUSE scripts (the ide) are available for
Windows as an installer or zip, or for Linux as a .deb, .rpm and .tar.gz file. Installing is very straight forward as
DEMUSE doesn't need anything other that that what is provided in the aforementioned installation packages.

If you do need help, or if something is working as it's supposed to be, feel free to create a new issue on the DEMUSE
repository on GitHub.

## IDE's

DEMUSE comes with it's own IDE which offers very basic coding notepad functionality like syntax highlighting, very basic
autocompletion and a run button that will compile your DEMUSE script and plays the resulting sound file.

However the IDE is completely optional, instead any plain text editor can be used to edit DEMUSE files. Simple pass your
script to the `compiler.exe` inside your chosen DEMUSE installation directory to compile your scripts into a sound file.

## Learning

There is a list of tutorials available on the Tutorials page. The online documentation also provides a list of all
objects and functions available in the language. And finally, a range of example programs are also available on the
Examples page.
