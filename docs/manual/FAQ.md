\section demuwhatnow What is DEMUSE?

DEMUSE is a simple toy language that creates music using a syntax greatly inspired by JavaScript and music trackers.
Being a toy language it is not meant to be used in an environment where proper programming language features are
required such as reliability, security and speed (who needs those anyway!).

It is great fun though!
